We are organizing Bangkok's first ever open-source program to encourage open source contributions in Thailand!

We aim to bring open source contributors, software engineers and domain experts to solve Bangkok's most pressing problems by developing easy-to-contribute open source projects (e.g. tools, libraries and datasets), and helping Bangkokians to contribute to existing open source projects.

Our program consists of a two-month program, with three workshops and a two-day hackathon, from February to March.

# Program Schedule

- Workshop #1 (Kick-off)

  - When: February 18th, 2023
  - Where: BITEC Bang Na, as part of the National Coding Day.

- Workshop #2: TBD

- Workshop #3: TBD

- Hackathon & Demo Day

  - When: March 25th - March 26th, 2023
  - Where: TBD
